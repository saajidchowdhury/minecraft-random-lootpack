# minecraft-random-lootpack
Python script which generates Minecraft datapack where all the loot tables are randomly permuted. 

First download all of these files. Then run `p.py`. This should generate a bunch of folders, including the folder "random_pack". 

Open Minecraft in version 1.21.11, in Singleplayer click "Create New World", click "More" on the top right, click "Data Packs".

Drag and drop the "random_pack" folder into the Minecraft window. Click "Yes".

You should see "random_pack" under "Available". Click the triangle to move it to the right half of the screen under "Selected".

Click "Done". Click "Create New World". 

When you break a block, kill a mob, open a generated chest, etc., the items will be different than you expect.
