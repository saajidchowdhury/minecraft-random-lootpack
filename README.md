# minecraft-random-lootpack

Python script which generates Minecraft datapack where all the loot tables are randomly permuted. 

Breaking a dirt block might give you zombie flesh, killing a zombie might give you end city chest loot; the possibilities are endless!

## Instructions

First download all of these files: click the Green "Code" button, click "Download ZIP", decompress the downloaded zip file. 

Then use Python to run the script `main.py`. This should generate a bunch of folders, including the folder "random_pack". 

Open Minecraft in version 1.21.11, in Singleplayer click "Create New World", click "More" on the top right, click "Data Packs".

Drag and drop the "random_pack" folder into the Minecraft window. Click "Yes".

You should see "random_pack" under "Available". Click the triangle to move it to the right half of the screen under "Selected".

Click "Done". Click "Create New World". 

When you break a block, kill a mob, open a generated chest, etc., the items will be different than you expect. 

## Special Features

Some of the default loot table items are given to you only under certain conditions, such as "`minecraft:killed_by_player`". 

For example, you can only get a Blaze rod if you yourself kill a Blaze. 

This random lootpack script removes all those conditions. 

So, no matter which block ends up with the Blaze lootpack, breaking that block is guaranteed to give you a Blaze rod. 

Since blaze rods are essential for making Eyes of Ender to beat the game, you can try to beat the game with this lootpack; it's a lot of fun.
